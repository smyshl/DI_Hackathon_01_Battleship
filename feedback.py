# The project partially works. 
# The playing field looks good and I see you did a great job with the DB too. 
# I like the way you used @classmethod, OOP, modules and all. 
# I would also like to mention that you did not forget to create DB and table. 

# And you used env and gitignore, which is correct, 
# but you still did not hide the db credentials there :) Anyway, nobody can use your localhost db, so there is no need to have your password there. 
# It is not a mistake - just my note. 

# The only thing is that I cannot really play :) 
# Some of the properties give an error and after placing a ship the game ends. So it looks a bit incomplete, but the logic and code looks very nice!

# Overall score: 7
